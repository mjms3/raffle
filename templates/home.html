        <h2>How will the raffle work?</h2>
        <h3>Gift Donation</h3>
        <p>You can donate gifts by uploading images of those <a href="{% url 'gift_create' %}">gifts</a>.
           The uploaded images will automatically be downsized to 600 pixels wide
           and a pixelated version of the image will be created. You can review and manage
            your donations <a href="{% url 'my_donations' %}">here</a>, including be able to reupload images if you are unhappy with
           the downsized or pixelated image. You will not be able to change the uploaded gifts
           once the raffle has started.
        </p>
        <h3>Ticket Purchase</h3>
        <p>
         You can purchase tickets <a href="{% url 'create_participation' %}">here</a>. Each ticket costs &pound;5. Exact details for
         how the gift matching and charitable donations will work will be following
         shortly but, rest assured, Cboe will be matching any donations.
         You will also be able to change the number of tickets you've purchased right up to the
         start of the raffle.
        </p>
        <h3>The Raffle</h3>
        <p>The raffle will be held virtually via this site, so make sure that you're logged in and have
        the raffle page up ready for the Christmas Party. Please note that the site and raffle format will
        not work on a small (eg mobile or tablet) screen.</p>
        <h3>After the raffle</h3>
        <p>Obviously, it's a little tricky to get gifts to people at the moment. After the raffle, everyone who has
        donated gifts will be supplied with a list of who has won those gifts and their email addresses. If the gift is
        a voucher or similar then they can send it to the recipient via email. If not, things will have to wait until
        we can finally see each other in person. But don't worry, we'll make sure we keep track of who should get what
        so we can remind people!</p>
